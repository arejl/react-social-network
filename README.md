# My Social Network

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). It is a basic social network-like app using React and Redux.

## How to use

A Strapi API downloadable [here](https://github.com/felhix/mini-api-social-network) is used as a database.

After downloading the API, run `npm i` and `npm run develop` in its folder, and enable all permissions related to posts for authenticated users, and "find" permissions for public users in the API admin interface.

Then, in this folder, run `npm i` and `npm run start` to start using the website.

## About the App

A user can sign up and log in to access a Twitter-like app, where they can post messages, see others' posts, and like posts. They can edit their own profile and see others' username and description.
